          <h2>Correlations Between Health Risks and Median Income</h2>
          <p>In general, Higher Income seems to be correlationd with less obesity, and less percentage of smokers. </p>
          <h2>Correlations Between Health Risks and Poverty Rate</h2>
          <p>While Poverty rate seems to be slightly correlated with health risks, though the correlations are weaker than those with Median Income. The closest correlation in this category seems to be between poverty rate and percentage who lack healthcare. </p>
          <h2>Correlations Between Health Risks and Age</h2>
          <p>Age seemed to be the least associated with any of the health risks, though there seems to be a slight negative correlation with percentage who lack healthcare. In other words, younger residents may more commonly lack healthcare. </p>
