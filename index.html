          <h4>The scatterplot shows us the percieved correlations between:</h4>
          <br>
          <h5>Health Risks and Median Household Income</h5>

          <p>In general, higher income seems to be correlated negatively with healthcare risks, with the strongest correlations (most tightly clustered datapoints) below 65,000 median household income.
            Among the healthcare risks, it appears that smoking is most strongly correlated negatively with median household income under 65,000, but obesity is more strongly correlated negatively accross the full range of states.
          </p>

          <h5>Health Risks and Poverty Rate</h5>

          <p>As expected, the poverty rate shows the inverse correlation with healthcare risks as median household income. 
            The strongest correlation in this group, however, seems to be between the poverty rate, and the rate of the population who lack healthcare. </p>

          <h5>Health Risks and Age</h5>

          <p>Age appears to be both the most normally distributed, with a heavily clustered mean around ~37 years, and also the least correlated with any of the healthcare risks.
            In other words, it looks as though age is less of a factor in healthcare risks than the financial metrics.
